RIDEtoLadakh 🌄🏍️: Adventure Tourism Platform
Project Status: Complete | Portfolio Showcase
Welcome to RideToLadakh, a full-stack web application designed for the modern adventure traveler. This project is a comprehensive demonstration of my proficiency in the MERN stack, focusing on robust API design, secure authentication, and a dynamic user experience.

🚀 The Vision: Conquer the Himalayas Digitally
This platform streamlines the entire trip-planning process for a Ladakh adventure. It's more than just a booking site; it's a complete adventure hub that allows users to seamlessly move from browsing destinations to securing their ride and hotel—all in one place.

🏗️ Technical Architecture
We chose a Monolithic MERN Architecture for rapid development and straightforward deployment, keeping the entire codebase unified under a single repository (a "mono-repo" style).

Component	Stack	Key Technologies
Backend (API)	Node.js, Express.js	MongoDB/Mongoose, JWT, Google OAuth
Frontend (UI)	React.js	Context API, Tailwind CSS, Axios
Database	NoSQL	MongoDB Atlas (Cloud-hosted)
Payments	Integrated Gateway	Razorpay / Stripe (Test Mode)
Deployment	CI/CD	Railway (Backend), Vercel/Netlify (Frontend)
